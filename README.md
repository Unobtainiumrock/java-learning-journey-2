# Under Construction
I'm in the process of pushing all my local Java code to GitHub. This process includes adding documentation and a README to each section. In my projects I went above and beyond what we were expected to know at this level (for my own sake of taking on a challenge) by leveraging my knowledge of data structures and algorithms. The teacher absolutely loved my passion for doing these extra tidbits.

# Where can you start?
* Each directory will have their own README.md explaining what each project is. Project 1 is currently the only project that's well-documented. More documentation is to come!

# List of Things To Be Added
I have a plethora of applications completed in Java that I'm incrementally uploading. Here's a list of things to come. It's not comprehensive, but it points out ones I find most pertinent to people assessing my level of Java knowledge.

* A program that reads input text files, parses the file input data for valid email addresses, and creates a new file containing valid emails extracted from the original file.
  
* Basic examples demonstrating my knowledge in Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract classes vs Interfaces. Unfortunately there's not any examples of compostion over inheritance, since that wasn't covered yet in the curriculum. I have however implemented composition in JavaScript.

* Demonstration of exception handling (checked and unchecked).

* A Hangman game built using JavaFX!

* Something not taught by my course that I'll be adding is demonstrating of multithreaded code and how to avoid deadlocking.
  
* Already added and fairly well-commented, **project 2** shows me writing ArrayList from scratch, since the teacher constrained us from being allowed to use ArrayList provided by java.util. I have logic in place for handling insertion and removal from the ArrayList. Start in Course.java and you can "file hop" to wherever need be.

## To Do
* Add README.md to all files. Do a code review and cleanup.
* Make sure that this is easy to discover for people trying to assess what my level of knowledge in Java consists of.
* Add the requirements outline for each project so that the people viewing my code can see how closley my work output matches the MVP requirements of each project.
